# css-vars-theming-dark-mode
This repo contains the Web files I used in my video "Dark Modes Using CSS Variables"
The video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/l0dOOSSST2Y)

## To Install

Just clone (or download) this repository, and open `index.html` on a browser. Make sure that it is an updated browser, as not all browser currently support CSS Variables.

## Some Notes

- Remember to create fallbacks for unsupporting browsers. This [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44271920/css-variables-with-fallback-for-older-browsers) gives you an idea how.
- Always check this [Can I Use? page for CSS Variables](https://caniuse.com/#search=custom%20proper) to track its support progress. :wink:
